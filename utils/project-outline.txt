- Create the project environment (Repository, virtual environment,version control)
1. Business Understanding
    - Problem Statement
    - Goal and Objectives
    - Stakeholders
    - Key Metrics and Success Criteria
    - Hypothesis (Null and Alternate)
    - Analytical Questions
    - Scope and Constraints
    - More Information about the project if applicable
2. Data Understanding
    1. Importation
    2. Load Dataset
    3. EDA
        1. Data Quality Assessment & Exploring data (info, duplicated, null values, describe)
        2. Univariate
        3. Bi-variate
        4. Multi-variate Analysis
    4. Answer Analytical questions with visulizations
    5. Test hypothesis
    6. Give your insights
3. Data Preparation
    1. Split data set into X, y
    2. Split data set into training and evaluation
    3. Feature Engineering (Creating New Features, (binning & bucketing), Handling Missing Data, Encoding, Standardization, 
        Normalization, Scaling)
      a. Create a pipeline to preprocess the data
        1. Separate inpute features into numeric and categorical for different pipelines
        2. Handle missing values using imputation Techniques
        3. Scaling or normalize numeric features
        4. Encode categorical features
        5. Transformations for skewed data (log, power, custom, etc)
        6. Balance dataset (depending on what you see)
    4. Encode label/target
4. Modeling 
    1. Fit data to the pipeline and train Model
        a.Train Model 1 - Distance based model
        b.Train Model 2 - Gradient Descent model
        c.Train Model 3 - Tree based model
        c.Train Model 4 - Neural Network
5. Evaluation
    1. Advance Model Evaluation and Visualizing Model Performance: (ROC curves, AUC, precision-recall curves, and confusion matrices).
    2. Feature Importance and Selection
    3. Hyperparameter Tuning: (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV, or Bayesian optimization.)
    4. Final Model Comparison & Selection: (Consider trade-offs and choose most apropriate)
    5. Retrain Model with best paramaters
    5. Business Impact Assessment and Documentation of the Model (How does what you choose affect the business?)
    6. Model Persistence
6. Deployment (Not applicable in this project)
    1. Deployment Strategy
    2. Model Monitoring and Maintenance
